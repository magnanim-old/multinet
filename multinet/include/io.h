/**
 * Reads a multilayer network from a list of edges. There are two main formats available. For multiplex
 * networks, were edges are only present inside a layer, edges are expressed as Actor1,Actor2,Layer.
 * For general multilayer networks, where edges can connect actors on different layers, edges are
 * expressed as Actor1,Layer1,Actor2,Layer2.
 * Directed/undirected edges, as well as attributes, are also supported. This is the complete accepted format:
 *
 * ----------------------------------
 * -- comment lines start with two dashes (--)
 *
 * #TYPE multiplex
 * -- or: "#TYPE multilayer", if there are inter-layer edges
 *
 * #ACTOR ATTRIBUTES
 * AttributeName1,STRING
 * AttributeName2,NUMERIC
 * -- etc.
 *
 * #NODE ATTRIBUTES
 * LayerName1,AttributeName1,STRING
 * LayerName1,AttributeName2,NUMERIC
 * -- etc.
 *
 * #EDGE ATTRIBUTES
 * -- if type is multiplex (default), edge attributes are indicated as follows:
 * LayerName1,AttributeName,STRING
 * LayerName2,AttributeName,NUMERIC
 * -- etc.
 * -- if type is multilayer, edge attributes are indicated as follows:
 * -- LayerName1,LayerName2,AttributeName,STRING
 * -- LayerName1,LayerName2,AttributeName,NUMERIC
 * -- etc.
 *
 *
 * #LAYERS
 * -- if type is multiplex (default), edge attributes are indicated as follows:
 * LayerName1,UNDIRECTED,AttributeValueList...
 * LayerName2,DIRECTED,AttributeValueList...
 * -- etc.
 * -- if type is multilayer, layers are indicated as follows:
 * -- LayerName1,LayerName1,UNDIRECTED,AttributeValueList...
 * -- LayerName2,LayerName2,DIRECTED,AttributeValueList...
 * -- LayerName1,LayerName2,DIRECTED
 * -- etc. and all intra-layer directionalities should be listed before inter-layer directionalities
 *
 * #ACTORS
 * ActorName1,AttributeValueList...
 * ActorName2,AttributeValueList...
 * -- etc.
 *
 * #NODES
 * ActorName1,LayerName1,AttributeValueList...
 * ActorName1,LayerName2,AttributeValueList...
 * -- etc.
 *
 * #EDGES
 * -- if TYPE is multiplex (default), edges are indicated as follows instead:
 * ActorName1,ActorName2,LayerName1,AttributeValueList...
 * -- etc.
 * -- if TYPE is multilayer, edges are indicated as follows:
 * -- ActorName1,LayerName1,ActorName2,LayerName2,AttributeValueList...
 * -- etc.
 *
 * ----------------------------------
 *
 * If the #LAYERS section is empty, undirected layers are created as mentioned in the #EDGES section.
 *
 * If the #LAYER ATTRIBUTES, #ACTOR ATTRIBUTES, #NODE ATTRIBUTES or #EDGE ATTRIBUTES sections are empty, no attributes are created.
 *
 * The #LAYERS #ACTORS and #NODES sections are useful only if attributes or unused actors are present, otherwise they can be omitted
 *
 * If no section is specified, #EDGES is the default.
 *
 * Therefore, a minimalistic undirected multiplex network file would look like this:
 * ----------------------------------
 * Matteo,Luca,Facebook
 * Matteo,Mark,Facebook
 * ...
 * ----------------------------------

 * @param network_name name assigned to the network
 * @param separator character used to separate fields in the input file
 * @param node_aligned if true, all actors are replicated on all layers, otherwise only actors explicitly listed in the #NODES section or with at least an edge are added to a given layer

 * edge attributes. If other variations are needed, the original multilayer network can be transformed

 * with an attribute indicating the corresponding actor. The first option builds a "traditional" multiplex network.
 * @param include_all_actors if parameter merge_actors is true, then we can decide which actors to include. If include_all_actors is true, all the actors in the multilayer network are included in the output. If false, only
 * actors that are present in the exported layers are included (see layers parameter). If merge_actors is false, this attribute is not used.
