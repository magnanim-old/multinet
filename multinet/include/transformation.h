 * Functions to transform a set of layers into a single one. A flattening is used when the same actors
 * are present on multiple layers: a new, single layer is created, and edges from all the flattened layers
 * contribute to the connectivity of the new layer. A projection creates a new layer where actors are taken from one layer and their connections depend
 * on how they are connected to objects in a second layer. Different types of flattening and projection
 * exist.
